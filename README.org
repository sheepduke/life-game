* Introduction

This repository uses different languages to demonstrate /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life][Conway's Game of Life]]/.

* Hierarchy

Each directory under root (this one) contains code written in one specific language.

* How to run

** Common Lisp

1. Install roswell
